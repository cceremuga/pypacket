class Receiver:
    """This is the main receiver class for PyPacket. It spawns two sub-processes
    in a separate thread.

    The first sub-process is the listener which listens on the configured
    frequency, sending all raw output to the second sub-process.

    The second sub-process is the decoder process. Once a received packet
    has been decoded, it is cleaned up, leaving the raw APRS String.

    The string is then logged to file and output to the CLI for easy reading.

    Portions of this source code are inspired by architectural concepts found
    in the PyMultimonAPRS project (https://github.com/asdil12/pymultimonaprs).
